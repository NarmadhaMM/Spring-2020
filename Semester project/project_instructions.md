Semester Project
================

The semester project consists of creating a Python program that solves a
specific problem or executes a specific task. The project may consist of more
than one function or python file.

Project Rules
-------------

-   Projects are individual

-   Projects need to be hosted in a public repository in your Github account

-   Projects must have a general documentation written in Markdown

-   Functions documentation must be written using Python comments (docstring).

-   Equations have to be written in LaTeX

-   Code must be Python 3

Components of project proposal
------------------------------

1.  Background and rationale (max 150 words)

2.  Objective of the code

3.  Outcomes: What tangible outcomes do you envision for your project? This is not just the output of a function.

4.  Sketch: A simple diagram or flow chart depicting the conceptual layout of
    your project.

5.  References

6.  Project proposal must not exceed one page

7.  Use Time New Romans 11 with one inch margins

8.  Save the file using your first and last name separated by an underscore (all
    lower case). For instance: john_smith.docx or john_smith.md

9.  You can send the proposal file by e-mail or just point me to your github
    project repository.

Project mid-semester feedback
-----------------------------------------

Students can always contact the main instructor to gain more feedback on:

-   goals and rationale of the project

-   creating a project diagram/sketch/flowchart

-   current progress and roadblocks


Project final oral presentation
-------------------------------

Students will need to make a 10-min presentation showcasing the project. The
presentation must include:

1.  A maximum of 5 slides for:

    -   background, rationale, and objective

    -   project diagram/sketch/flowchart

    -   main tools, modules, libraries used in the project

    -   required inputs and project outputs

    -   challenges that you faced while creating the project and how you solved
        the problems

2.  Live demonstration of the code with an example

Grading
-------

In general terms, the final grade for your project will be based on:

-   Creativity

-   Clear rationale and problem statement

-   Attention to detail in documentation, figures, and final presentation

-   Project complexity. This is probably the hardest point to get right, so keep
    it simple at the beginning and start adding more complexity as you progress. 
    The more you advance in your project the more ideas you will have
    to make it better. The project needs to make use of multiple concepts
    covered in class and beyond. Ensure that the project can be accomplished
    during the semester.

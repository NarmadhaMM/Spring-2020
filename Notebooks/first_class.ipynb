    ">“I think that great programming is not all that dissimilar to great art. Once you start thinking in concepts of programming it makes you a better person...as does learning a foreign language, as does learning math, as does learning how to read.“ —*Jack Dorsey. Creator, Twitter. Founder and CEO, Square*\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Software touches all of these different things you use, and tech companies are revolutionizing all different areas of the world...from how we shop to how farming works, all these things that aren't technical are being turned upside down by software. So being able to play in that universe really makes a difference.“ —*Drew Houston. Founder & CEO, Dropbox*\n",
    "\n",
    ">“To prepare humanity for the next 100 years, we need more of our children to learn computer programming skills, regardless of their future profession. Along with reading and writing, the ability to program is going to define what an educated person is.“ —*Salman Khan. Founder, Khan Academy*\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Learning to speak the language of information gives you the power to transform the world.“ —*Peter Denning. Association of Computing Machinery, former President*\n",

    "* Before coding I was confined into analysis of variance and significant differences. Coding enabled spatio-temporal analysis, numerical simulation of physically-based processes, curve fitting and parameter optimization\n",
    "* Coding forced me to think logically, break down a large problem into smaller pieces, and increase attention to seemingly irrelevant details\n",
    "* Track the work and reasoning of students (and colleagues).\n",

    "# **Installating packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this class you will need to install the Anaconda package, Git, and create an account in Github. We will write code using the web browser, so I recommend having Google Chrome installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anaconda Package\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Anaconda environment, which is a set of curated python packages commonly used in science and engineering. The Anaconda environment is available for free by Continuum Analytics. The latest Anaconda package already has Python 3.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Download the anaconda installer\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you have a windows machine go to: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows>\n",
    "* If you have a mac go to: <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Install Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "* Double click on the installer and follow the steps. When asked, I highly suggest installing VS Code, which is a powerful editor with autocomplition, debugging capabilities, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Open Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Windows go to the start up menu in the bottom left corner of the screen and then click on the Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Macs go to Applications and double click on the Anaconda Navigator. Alternatively you can use the search bars (in Mac press Command + Space bar).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook**: We will write most of our code using notebooks, which are ideal for reproducible research.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **VS Code**: A powerful and modern code editor. You can download it and code here if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spyder**: An integrated development environment for scientific coding in Python. It features a graphical user interface similar to that of Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Update Anoaconda package\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "* Click on the arrow next to \"base(root)\"\n",
    "* Select \"Open terminal\"\n",
    "* Type the following command in the terminal: `conda update --all`\n",
    "* Wait few seconds and agree to the update by typing \"`y`\"\n",
    "* The update process may take several minutes. Sometimes the computer will request your authorization for `python` to make changes in your drive. Agree to the changes in order to proceed.\n",

    "1. Go to: https://git-scm.com\n",
    "2. Select Windows/MacOS\n",
    "3. Follow the installer and use default intallation settings\n",

    "\n",
    "**How do I get started with Github?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a Github account at: https://github.com/\n",
    "2. Create a repository. Make sure to add a **README** file.\n",
    "3. Go to your computer and open the terminal\n",
    "4. Navigate to a directory where you want to place the repository\n",
    "5. Clone the Github repository using: git clone `<link>`"

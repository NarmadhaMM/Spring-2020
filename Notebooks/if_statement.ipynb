    "The `if` statements play a fundamental role controlling the logical flow of the code. A sequence of decision rules instruct the computer to execut specific commands. If statements evaluate whether a condition is `True` or `False` and at that point the code bifurcates. Sometimes there multiple conditions as part of a single `If` statements, in which the code could branch into many different options."

    "A simple exercise to learn the basic structure of `If` staments is to compute and print whether a given number is odd or even. Even numbers are divisible by 2 with a reminder of zero whereas odd numbers are not divisible by 2 and have remainder greater than zero. To perform this operation we can use the Python `modulo` operator, which represented by `%`."

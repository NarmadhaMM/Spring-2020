    "## Hydrometer Readings\n",
    "\n",
    "The hydrometer method is one of the most popular methods for soil particle size analysis. The method consists of dispersion a known amount of ground (<2 mm sieve) and dry soil in a solution of de-ionized water with sodium hexametaphosphate (dispersing agent). Readings with a hydrometer are made at specific times according to the particle the diameter that we want to measure and the height of the containing cylinder. These times are calculated based on Stoke's law. In many labs readings are taken at two points to determine the amount of sand, silt, and clay. To build a detailed curve of particle sizes, hydrometer readings need to be made more frequently. As part of the method there is a blank treatment that only contains de-ionized water and sodium hexametaphosphate, but no soil, so that we substract the effect of the dispersig agent from the readings.\n",
